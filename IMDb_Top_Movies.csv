He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath's gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he's like a really scary psychopath. He's a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture."" Caine bases this belief on a scene where The Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne's penthouse. He'd never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed, he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines."

When he returned to work, he was fascinated to find that nobody would mention or acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such commonplace things as ""How was your weekend?"" Palahniuk concluded that the reason people reacted this way was because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to connect with him on a personal level. It was his fascination with this societal 'blocking' which became the foundation for the novel."

Despite a good deal of research, he did not feel he had enough solid factual information to make the movie. He then pitched the idea of a film that would cover a series of five samurai battles, based on the lives of famous Japanese swordsmen. Hashimoto went off to write that script, but Kurosawa ultimately scrapped that idea as well, worrying that a film that was just ""a series of climaxes"" wouldn't work. Then, producer Sôjirô Motoki found, through historical research, that samurai in the ""Warring States"" period of Japanese history would often volunteer to stand guard at peasant villages overnight in exchange for food and lodging. Kurosawa then came across an anecdote about a village hiring samurai to protect them and decided to use that idea. Kurosawa wrote a complete dossier for each character with a speaking role. In it were details about what they wore, their favourite foods, their past history, their speaking habits, their reaction to battle and every other detail he could think of about them. No other Japanese director had ever done this before."

Billy Wilder later recalled a day that was set aside just for shooting reaction shots of the jury and courtroom crowd (composed of extras hired only for the day). Normally, the assistant director would read the actors' lines, and the extras would react. However, Laughton, who was fascinated with the whole process of filmmaking, begged to help. So he came in on his day off and read all of the off-camera speeches for the jury members. He not only read his part but also the judge's, the prosecutor's, and even Marlene Dietrich's. According to biographer Maurice Zolotow in his book ""Billy Wilder in Hollywood"", ""it was an exhibition of craftsmanship such as Wilder had never seen.

Actually, Hitchcock wanted Cary Grant to play the role. By the time Hitchcock realized the misunderstanding, Stewart was so anxious to play Thornhill that rejecting him would have caused a great deal of disappointment. So Hitchcock delayed production on this movie until Stewart was already safely committed to filming Otto Preminger's ""Anatomy of a Murder (1959)"" before ""officially"" offering him the role in this movie. Stewart had no choice but to turn down the offer, allowing Hitchcock to cast Grant, the actor he had wanted all along."

The company charged itself rent for the use of the then-unfinished building.

Krizan rode around Europe on trains meeting people and on one trip met a Norwegian man on the way to Paris, and ended up walking around the city all night much like Before Sunrise (1995). Krizan has never revealed whether or not they had a romance that night and they lost contact.Linklater and Amy stayed in touch for a while, until contact was lost and he never heard from her again. It was not until 2010 that Linklater found out that Amy had died in a traffic accident before the release of Before Sunrise (1995), the first film in the trilogy. Krizan has never re-connected with the Norwegian man that was her inspiration for the famous night of walking around a European city."

Though they initially stayed in touch over the telephone, they lost contact eventually. In 1994, Linklater shot Before Sunrise (1995), based on his night with Amy. Like Jesse in ""Before Sunset"", Linklater was secretly hoping that Amy had heard of the movie, and would show up at the premiere, but she did not. When ""Before Sunset"" was released, she did not show up either. It wasn't until 2010, before Linklater started production on the second sequel, Before Midnight (2013), that a friend of Amy, who knew about their story, contacted Linklater to tell him that Amy had died in a motorcycle accident on May 9, 1994, at the age of 24, a few weeks before he started shooting Before Sunrise (1995)."
